        <h4>Mold and Cast</h4>
        <p>For this assignment I decided to mold a small Spiderman figurine and cast ice replicas. I chose this object due to it's intricate features and complex structure. However, I think the figure was a little too much to tackle for my first attempt at molding and casting for these very reasons.</p>
        <p>Once I had chosen my object, I had to create a simple cage to contain the epoxy. I constructed this container out of mat carboard due to it's smooth faces and considerable sterength. After measuring and cutting the 4 walls and base, I joined all of them together using duct tape. In an attempt to make it water proof, so no epoxy leaks out while curing, I tried to cover the entire box with duct tape. As you can see from the image on the right, this did not work.</p>

        <p>With the cage complete, I began the preparations of the two part epoxy. Rather than claculating how much epoxy would be requiered to fill the cage, I guessed, which was without a doubt the wrong decision. After stirring both parts, I assumed that 200 cc total (100 cc part A, 100 cc part B) would be enough to cover the figurine by around a centimeter. After mixing the two parts for 3 minutes I began to pour, but it became quickly apparent that this would not be enough. The small bump in the image to the right is actually the top of the head of the figurine. I would have added more epoxy to get a nice layer over the top, but I had used all of the available epoxy from the kit to reach the 200 cc mark already. </p>

        <p>I let the mold cure overnight since I wanted to make sure it was completly set before I removed it. When I woke up I realized that the cage was not entirely water proof since there was a lot of excess epoxy on my work bench that had not been there the previous night. Luckily it wasn't all that much so there was still a decent layer atop the head of the spiderman. In order get the figuerine out, I first did one large zig-zagged cut around the entire mold. This worked to release one half of the figurine but the second half contained the entire head section which made it stuck. To get around this, I cut the half into quarters, splitting the head section in two. This worked perfectly to release the figurine from the mold.</p>

        <p>With the mold complete, I reassembled it and kept it tight using two ruber bands. Once I started pouring water into the base, though, I saw that the top of the head and hand, that I had failed to cover, had small holes that were causing the water to leak out. In order to stop this, I used hot glue to cover the roof of the mold so no water would escape. I then placed the water-filled epoxy into the freezer and let it sit over night. When I removed the mold, I was quite nervous to see if the cast would stay together when I attempted to open it. Sadly, my fears came true. As I was opening the mold, a small portion of the back leg and hand snapped off and remained stuck in the mold, but the rest came out easily.</p>
        <p>Having completed the project, there are many things that I would change if I were to do this again. I would have:
          <ul>
            <li>used hot glue to completly seal the edges of the cage to prevent leakage.</li>
            <li>calculated the volume of the cage to see how much epoxy is requiered to completly cover the object.</li>
            <li>removed the figurine fron it's base to lower its height.</li>
            <li>dyed the water so more of the design would have shown.</li> 
          </ul>
