        <p> I was able to come up with 2 ideas for my final project, one of which has a more prctical uses than the other. The first idea I came up with was inspired by my fascination with Formula 1 and the cars themselves. I was thinking about recreating a scaled down version of the car which would be able to be remotely controlled by an app on your phone. I would use laser cut peices to replicate the intricate designs of the cars and hide the motors and programmable electronics which enable the car to move. One way to take this idea further, but may be too ambitious, is too program real circuits into the app which the car would then be able to follow.</p>

        <p style="font-size:60%;"> This idea has already been done, as seen with the planter above, but I wanted to adapt it or make it in my own way. Not sure if that is ok for the final project, however.</p>

        <p>My second idea, which would actually solve a problem, has to do with planting/gardening. I would create a sensor which would test the hydration of soil inorder to tell me wether my plant requires watering. When the hydration content is below a certain level the sensor would then trigger a signal, sending a message to my phone or computer. It would tell me to water my plant through a text message, email or some other form of communication I have currently forgotten about. This project also offers more opportunities to further devlop it in the future such as creating a water delivery system, cutting out the need for human watering entirely. </p>
