        <p>   Hello! My name is Nicola Hensch and I am a rising high school Senior from Newton Massachusetts. Some of my favorite hobbies are swimming, drumming, and hanging out with my older brothers. I am the youngest of three boys and I also have two Portuguese water dogs, photo below. This summer I will be lifeguarding at a local country club and training for upcoming swim meets in July/August. I look forward to seeing what we will create in this class and can't wait to get to know everybody!</p>
