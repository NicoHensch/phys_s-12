    <h4><b> Assignment </b></h4>
    <br>
    <p> This weeks assignment was to create a website and make a page with a proposal for a final project, download and install all requiered software, and reasearch locl fab labs and maker spaces.</p>
    <br>
    <h5> Website Development </h5>
    <p> In order to create a website and a page for my final project proposal, I utilized and changed the given index.html code found on the class website. I was able to create links to About Me and Final Project pages as well as to the Class website using simple href codes (example shown below). Whenever I got stuck I would refrence this helpful website called W<sup>3</sup> school, linked <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp'>here</a>, in order to learn new html and css attributes that are used to solve similar problems to the ones I faced. </p>

    <h4><b>Reading</b></h4>
  </div>
  <div class="row">  
    <p> Read Chapters 1-3 of <a href='http://mars1980.github.io/resources/making_things_move.pdf'>Making Things Move</a>. Make a note of some of the more interesting points you learn. </p>
    <p> Interesting things I learned in chapters 1-3: An interesting thing I learned while reading was that 3 points make up the minimum contraint design while 4 is too many. Having too many points can often lead to problems, hence why 4-legged tables wobble. However, 3 legged tables can still fall over. That is why we use 4 wheels for cars since they won't tip over, making the 4th wheel a redundant constraint since it is not requiered, but still very helpful.</p>

    <h4><b> Fab Labs </b></h4>
    <br>
    <p> I am lucky to live near Harvard and MIT which means that there are many local Fab labs and maker spaces which I can go to. The two closest to me are the Dassault Systemes 3DEXPERIENCE Lab Boston in Waltham, MA, and the WHS Wayshak Fab Lab in Watertown, MA.</p>
