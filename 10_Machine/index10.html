  <h3>Week 10: Machine Building</h3> <br> 
  <div class="container-fluid">
      <h4><b>Assignment</b></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Make a machine that is controlled either by a computer or phone. Must include at least one stepper motor.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Music Machine</h4>
      <p>For this weeks assignment, I did not kniow what to make for a while since I had never used stepper motors before. After doing some research, i.e. watching a lot of youtube videos, I stumbled on some pretty cool stepper motor music machines. Using different frequencies, the stepper motor is able to rotate at different rates which causes the tone of the motor to change thus producing music. All of the machines I saw used more than one stepper motor to creat chords and mimick different instruments, but since I had never actually made anything with a stepper motor, I decided to just use a single stepper motor. Lucky for me, I was able to find a pretty simple and straightforward tutorial linked <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Make-Music-With-Stepper-Motors/"> here</a> that helped guide me through the process of making the music. It had a helpful table that listed out the frequencies for all of the notes and also gave me the setup functions to all of the notes allowing for easier music writing in arduino. I wired up the stepper motor in the same way we did in class.</p>

      <p>Once I had the stepper motor making music, I had to work on making a website that would control which song would be played. I once again used google Firebase because I felt comfortable with it and wanted to use it more. I created a new project, named it Stepper Music, changed the rules to "true", and created a new html file in my week 10 folder for the new webpage. The html code that I used vcan be found on the class website under the week 9 Networking tab's tutorials. After copying the web generated configuration into my code, I also adapted the buttons. First, I changed the On button to "Mario Theme" and added two more buttons, titled "Rob Scallon Rain" and "Wii Theme". This meant I had four buttons in total on the webpage. The code that I copied and changed to do these steps are <code>document.getElementById('turn-off').addEventListener('click', turnOff, false);</code>, <code> >button id="turn-off" name="turnoff">Turn Off /button></code> and <pre><code> function turnOff(){
    console.log("turning off");
    ref.update({
      "STEPPER_STATUS": "OFF"
    });
  }
</code></pre>. The first is an event listener which makes the makes the buttons call up a certain arduino code, the second creates the button on the webpage, and the third updates the status on firebase, activating the arduino code. Once I had all of the html code sorted, I switched over to arduino. First I had to change the given code from the course website to fit my needs. The first thing I did was adding/changing the pins to include step and dir for the motor and including my SSID and Password so it could connect to my wifi. I also added the pinmodes and notes to the setup function so they can be called down later. The next big thing I added was the two <code> void note()</code> and <code>void pa()</code> so the notes and pauses were all defined in later steps. Then came the actual music. From the example code, I changed the ON button to the Mario theme, placing the note structure after the <code>Serial.println</code>. I repeated the step for Rod Scallons Rain and lef the off function as was. Here is a video of both songs being played</p>

      <p> While testing the buttons, I came across a problem with my second function, the Rain song. I noticed that it took quite a while to start playing the song after being pushed. I think this is due to me using the delay function in my songs. Since Rain is the second button/second function, I beleive arduino is running through the rntire Mario theme song first, checking to see if the criteria is met before reaching the Rain function. This makes quite the delay between the two. If I had more time, I would have tried to use the <code>switch case</code> function to see if it could cut down on the delay time. The next thing I did was to try and write the code for the Wii Channel Theme. This was quite difficult
