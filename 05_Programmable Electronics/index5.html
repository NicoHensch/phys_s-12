      <h4><b>Assignment</b></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Program a microcontroller to produce an output using at least one button for input. Include a conditional statement and a for() loop.</li>
        <li>Think about your final project and any additional components you might want. Start working on the 3D design for your project, especially components you might want to be lasercut or 3D printed. We can't make any promises, but we will do our best to accommodate requests within reason. Next Tuesday the 13th is the deadline for requests, in order for us to print/cut, mail, and get to you in time for you to assemble your project. (This will also be your assignment for next class). Please feel free to send us your designs prior to that for feedback. Please also feel free to use models from this collection of 3D models of kit components, or from other online collections like grabcad.com or Thingiverse.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>My Program</h4>
      <p>For this assignment, I decided to try and make an LED get brighter and then dimmer while a button is pressed, and when the button is unpressed, make another LED continuosly brighten and dim. I began by using the example code we worked on during the lab session on Wednesday, the 7th.</p>  
        <pre><code class="language-arduino"> 
          int buttonPin = 2;
          int ledPin = 13;


          void setup() {
              // put your setup code here, to run once:
              pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP);

          }

          void loop() {
              // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
              if  (digitalRead(buttonPin) == LOW) {

          //for (inti; test; update);
          for (int i = 225; i >= 0; i--) {
            analogWrite(ledPin, i);
            delay(10);

            }

          }
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p> The first adaptaion I made was to the original for() loop values. I changed them to <code> for(int i = 0; i <= 255; i++) </code>. I left the analogWrite and delay functions the same. This adapted for() loop makes the built-in led get brighter after a single button press. Once I had the brightening process figuered out, I then worked on trying to dim the LED. At first I thought that I had to use an } else{ function since I had used an if statement before hand. After talking to Victoria and getting some help from Faraz, I learned that I did not have to since I wanted the dimming process to occur in the same loop as the brightening function. The new code I added is actually the same as what I had in the original code which was <pre><code class="language-arduino"> 
        for (int i = 225; i >= 0; i--) {
          analogWrite(ledPin, i);
          delay(10);
        }
      </code></pre> This gave me a complete brightening and dimming cycles for the bult-in LED. I then copied and pasted both of the for loops in front of the if statment so I could control anoter, external, LED. This Green LED was defined at the top of my code and was connected to pin 10. Because I created new for() loops for the new LED, I had to change the term variables. I changed them from "i" to "g" since the code was for the green LED. Below is all of my code, a photo of my circuit, and a video as well.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-arduino hljs">
        int buttonPin = 2;
        int ledPin = 13;
        int ledGreen = 10;

        void setup() {
          // put your setup code here, to run once:
          pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP);
          pinMode(ledGreen, OUTPUT);
        }

        void loop() {
          // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
          // light cycle for the green LED.
          for (int g = 0; g <= 225; g++) {
            analogWrite(ledGreen, g);
            delay(10);
          }
          for (int g = 225; g >= 0; g--) {
            analogWrite(ledGreen, g);
            delay(10);
          }
          //light cycle for the built in LED that starts only when the button is pressed. 
          if (digitalRead(buttonPin) == LOW) {
            Serial.println(digitalRead(buttonPin));
            //for (inti; test; update);
            for (int i = 0; i <= 225; i++) {
              analogWrite(ledPin, i);
              delay(10);
            }
            for (int i = 225; i >= 0; i--) {
              analogWrite(ledPin, i);
              delay(10);
            }
          }
        }
