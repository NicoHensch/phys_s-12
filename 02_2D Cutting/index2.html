      <h4><b>Assignment</b></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow a Fusion360 tutorial</li>
        <li>Model 2 kit items (or a household item) using calipers</li>
        <li>Create an assembly of multiple components</li>
      </ul> 
      <h5><b>Tutorial</b></h5>
      <p>The turotial on Fusion 360 that I watched and followed was the first one recommended by Proffesor Melenbrink which can be found on our class website under the week 2 page or right <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVFYrBClkPc&t=313s'>here</a>. The first part of the tutorial taught me how to use the line tool properly. As seen with the screen shot below, I was able to use the line tool to create this object which includes an arc and non perpendicular line segments. This was all done without leaving the line tool mode which I never realized was possible. This section of the tutotrial also taught me how to use the dimension function to more accuratley mark and define the parameters of my object which included angles and diameter.</p>

      <p> The second part of the tutorial taught me how to create circles, connect them with tangent lines, and trim the curves in order to create a singular object. The circle tool can be found below the create section and can be placed anywhere. In order to connect them I used the line tool to find their tangent points which is symbolized with a circle and line below it (rather than an X). The image below is my object before using the trimming tool.</p>

      <p>After using the trim tool, the once seperated circles had come together into a singular object which resembles two gears connected with a fixed chain.</p>
      <img src="./Tutorial 3.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:50%" alt="Tutorial 3">
      <p>The last part of the Tutorial taught me how to create another shape, an elipse which was similar to a circle, except that it requires 4 points rather than 2 to be created. The elipse tool can be found under the same create tab as circles and lines in the upper left hand corner.</p>
      <h5><b>Household Item Model</b></h5>
      <p>The household item that I attempted to model in Fusion 360 was my pencil holder. Although it was quite simple to recreate, it did teach me new skills for creating solids. The cup is made up of three cylindrical components joined together. I started out with a simple circular sketch with a diameter of 103.1 mm. I finished the sketch and then used the extrude function to raise it to a height of 2.5 mm. Using the cylinder function, I then created another circle based and joined to the first cylinder with a diameter of 108.5 mm and a height of 136.3 mm. I then repeated the previous step, this time with a cylinder of diameter 115.2 mm and a height of 2.6 mm. Lastly, I used the hole function for solids to bore out a hole from the top of the cup all the way to just before the bottom(otherwise there would be no bottom end sealing the cup). I then filleted the edges and saved my object. I wanted to try and add texture to my cup since it has a cross-hash pattern but I am unsure how to do so.<br>

      <h5><b>Assembly of Multiple Components</b></h5>
      <p> For my assembly I tried to re-create a digitial clock I have on my desk. It is made up of two components, a front cover that can hide the clock, and then the clock itself. I started off by focusing on the main clock body and measured it's right profile. I did this so I could then translate the measurments into a sketch on Fusion 360 that was eventually extruded to create the main body. Once I had the main shape, I added some details such as the buttons on top and the circular display which shows the time. Once I had the main body, I moved on to the cover. I once again measuered and sketched the right profile of the object, so that I would have an easier time extruding and creating the final 3D model. Once I had the two seperate components, I dropped them into the same file inorder to make them an assembly.</p>
