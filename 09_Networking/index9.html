      <h4><b>Assignment</b></h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="./Firebase copy.html">Link</a></li>
        <li>Control a board from a local wireless network. Program a microcontroller to obtain and respond to information from the internet. Optionally, work with a partner to control a device over a remote server.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Motor Controls</h4>
      <p> For this assignment, I decided to try and work on my final project, an RC car. After working through the basic examples on how to use local networks, I decided to try and use the Google firebase application to make a website that would control the speed, direction, and power of my car. For now, I just tried to get the website to turn on a single DC motor and make a slider that controls the speed and irection like a potentiometer would. I started off by following the tutorial on google firebase that can be found on the class website. Once I was able to control an LED from the Realtime database, I started working on creating a webpage, similar to the one Professor Melenbrink had. This was quite difficult for me since the steps on the class website were a bit unclear in my opinion. Once I had copied and made a new html file, I moved it into this weeks folder on Sublime text. I then adapted the code with the web generated configuration variables after I had finished following all of the steps on Firebase. Once I knew that the buttons continued to work to turn on and off my LED, I then wired up a DC motor to my ESP32 Huzzah. I used pins 4 and 5 for the A1-A and A1-B motor driver ports and 3V instead of 5 since there is no 5v option for ESP32 boards.
